### wheelImageBase
usage: roulette's body image, its zIndex is smaller than highlight;
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: the ratio of this image should be square

### wheelImageOverlay
usage: roulette's body image, its zIndex is bigger than highlight;
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: the ratio of this image should be square

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmitriy-morozov/react-fortune-roulette/refs/heads/master/assets/wheel_image_overlay.png" alt="wheel_image_overlay" width="400" />

### highlightImage 
usage: when roulette rotate over, hightlight will bling bling, its purpose is to highlight the winning-prize;      
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: the ratio of this image should be square

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmitriy-morozov/react-fortune-roulette/refs/heads/master/assets/highlight.png" alt="highlight" width="400" />

### pointerImage
usage: roulette's pointer, to point the winning-prize;       
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: the ratio of this image should be square

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmitriy-morozov/react-fortune-roulette/refs/heads/master/assets/pointer.png" alt="Preview" width="400" />

#### PS1: you can put your roulette's body image on one of them or both; just due to different design, something will be under the highlight and something will be on the highlight, so let you have more option to combine your roulette
#### PS2: your roulette should put like this: 
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmitriy-morozov/react-fortune-roulette/refs/heads/master/assets/correct.jpeg" alt="Correct" width="500" />

#### not like this:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmitriy-morozov/react-fortune-roulette/refs/heads/master/assets/incorrect.jpeg" alt="Incorrect" width="500" />

#### PS: the prize you win always on top, so your pointer should always point toward that one, like this:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmitriy-morozov/react-fortune-roulette/refs/heads/master/assets/pointer.jpeg" alt="Preview" width="500" />
